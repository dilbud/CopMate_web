    <h2>
      New Procedure
    </h2>
  </mat-card>
  <h3>
    brief indrodution
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is an online mobile application for police officers not to keep driving licence of drivers
    and issue a fine sheet and drivers can pay that from any post office in the country.
    Because nowadays drivers have to go to the police station that keeps their driving license when they
    are caught for breaking driving rules.
    As an example,
    if someone goes on a trip from matara
    to kandy he can be caught “by kandy” traffic police .
    They keep their licence card at kandy police station until the required fine fee will be paid.
    So high time wastage and difficulty was faced there when they traveled back to that specific police station for the fine payment. This
    was discussed on Neth fm what if we have a method to overcome this problem.
    Now here is the solution that we proposed to overcome that practical problem.
    Creating an online website and mobile application to put all the drivers details to the system and any
    traffic policeman can issue a fine sheet for drivers with specifying real mistakes done by the
    driver using this application that supply the evidence and fall fine sheet issuing will be
    cancelled through this.
    And every traffic policeman can view the drivers early status of
    driving faults and that they paid for the fines by any place in the country.
    So they don't need to keep their licence because of that and it will be easier for anyone to not waste their time at
    the police stations.
 And also we hope to introduce another function to send a direct notification to the nearest
    police station and hospital easily when a road accident happens.
     So that will increase the safety of public people through this application.
    Still there is no solution to solve this problem.
    so this project will fulfill that practical problem through this solution.

    project scope
  </h2>
</mat-card>
<p>
  Police officers can get drivers details through scanning the barcode of driver license.
</p>
<p>
  optionally if the scanning is not working not yet in the license card they can use NIC
numbers to get the details of the driver.
</p>
<p>
  Fine statement generating through a pdf generator
</p>
<p>
  Availability of payment method to pay those fines
</p>
<p>
Send a reminder via sms to the driver to pay the fine
</p>
<p>
  Showing the on duty police officers around 2km trough google map it will help to catch
  Escaping drivers that did a wrong things
</p>
<p>
  Notification system to the nearest police stations and hospitals when road accident happen
</p>
<p>
  Tracking history of faults done by the drivers and their fine payment history
</p>
<p>
  can input the evidence to the system as images
</p>
<p>
  We hope to use waterfall software process model to built the application
</p>
